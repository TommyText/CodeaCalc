CodeaCalc
=========

A very simple calculator made with [Codea on the iPad][1].

Installation
------------

Unfortunately Codea does not currently allow for import / export of
projects, so you will have to manually create each one of the files and
paste the contents in your application.

1. Create a `Calculator` project in Codea
2. Create files named `Button`, `Display`, `Engine` and
   `StandardCalculator`, and copy the contents of the respective files
   in this project.
3. Replace the contents of the `Main` file with those of the `Main.lua`
   file included in this project.
4. Hit the play button!
